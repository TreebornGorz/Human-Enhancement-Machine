# Human-Optimizer

This algorithm provides a holistic approach to improving human health by collecting data, learning individual humans, and offering suggestions.

Human health can be broken down into three components: phsyical, mental, practical, and spiritual.

Humans may naturally focus on certain components while ignoring others. 

The Human Enhancement Machine assists these humans by providing curated suggestions.

Physical: Diet, Exercise, Environment, and Illness

Mental: Cognitive, Emotional, & Behavioral

Practical: Preparation, Organization

Spiritual: Mindfulness, Fulfillment, Beliefs, & Values 

By addressing those core components of human health, humans can unlock potential that would otherwise be unachievable.
