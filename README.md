# Human-Enhancement-Algorithm

This algorithm provides a holistic approach for improving human health by learning individual humans and providing curated suggestions.

Human health can be broken down into four main components: physical, mental, practical, and spiritual.

Humans may naturally focus on certain components while ignoring others, often to their subconscious detriment. 

Physical: Sleep, Diet, Exercise, Environment, & Illness

Mental: Cognitive, Emotional, & Behavioral

Practical: Preparation & Organization

Spiritual: Mindfulness, Beliefs, & Values 

By addressing these core components of human health and improving their behaviors in an intelligent way, humans can unlock enhance themselves and unlock potential that would be otherwise unavailable.
